		<h1>Support</h1>
		<p>So, I spent a fair whack of time building this, and I'm going to spend more maintaining it, and while I'm happy to do it, my landlord prefers that I spend my time making money to give to him, and my student loan company is almost as insistent. So, if you want to support me -and make it possible for me to keep doing this sort of thing with my time- it would be really cool if you threw a little cash my way. Here are a couple of ways you can do that!

<script type="text/javascript">
	function fixHeight(){}
</script>
<!--<script type="text/javascript" src="js\helper.js"></script>-->
